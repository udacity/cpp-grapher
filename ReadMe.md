### IDE Support
If you are more comfortable with GUI-based development, I recommend taking a look at [JetBrains' CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).  It works with C++11/14 with "Intellisense" and refactoring tools, CMake dependency management and has cross-platform (Mac/Linux/Windows) support.
